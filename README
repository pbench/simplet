Simplet: Solver for tropical linear programs based on the simplex method

Given an arbitrary tropical linear program, Simplet finds an optimal 
solution, or determines emptyness/unboundedness.

This software was developed when the author was a PhD student at 
CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, with a fellowship funded by the Delegation 
Generale de l'Armement (DGA) and the Ecole Polytechnique (Monge fellowship).

***************************************************************************
INSTALLATION AND USAGE

Make sure that you have Ocaml >=4.0 installed.
In the parent directory, call:
 make
This will create an executable named 'simplet'.

You can then solve a tropical linear program described in 
a file 'input_file' by typing:
 ./simplet input_file

To get a log of the computation performed, type:
 ./simplet input_file -log log_file

Some input files are given in the directory 'examples/'. In particular,
see 'examples/first' for an explaination of the syntax of the input files.

**********************************************************************
DEVELOPEMENT

The source files are in the directory 'src/'. In there the files 'parser.ml'
and 'parser.mli' have been generated from '_parser.mly' using the software menhir.
If you want to modify the parser, you must install menhir from:
 http://http://cristal.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/
After modifying '_parser.mly', call
 make parser
to update 'parser.ml' and 'parser.mli', and then call
 make

You can compile a debug version with 
 make debug
This will create an executable 'debug_simplet' which can be used with the ocaml debugger as:
 ocamldebug ./debug_simplet input_file

You can build an html documenation from the source code with
 make doc
